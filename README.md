Image classification is the process of categorizing and labeling groups of pixels or vectors within an image based on specific rules. The categorization law can be devised using one or more spectral or textural characteristics.
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification and regression tasks. In this article, we will focus on using SVMs for image classification.

When a computer processes an image, it perceives it as a two-dimensional array of pixels. The size of the array corresponds to the resolution of the image, for example, if the image is 200 pixels wide and 200 pixels tall, the array will have the dimensions 200 x 200 x 3. The first two dimensions represent the width and height of the image, respectively, while the third dimension represents the RGB color channels. The values in the array can range from 0 to 255, which indicates the intensity of the pixel at each point.

In order to classify an image using an SVM, we first need to extract features from the image. These features can be the color values of the pixels, edge detection, or even the textures present in the image. Once the features are extracted, we can use them as input for the SVM algorithm.

The SVM algorithm works by finding the hyperplane that separates the different classes in the feature space. The key idea behind SVMs is to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin, which is the distance between the closest points of the different classes. The points that are closest to the hyperplane are called support vectors.
